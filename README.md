# Python module 04 : Cyber Archives – Data Archivist

A Python project designed for students of School 42.
This module introduces file handling, stream management, and secure resource control through a futuristic digital archive simulation based on the official Cyber Archives – Data Archivist subject.

You are trained as a Data Archivist in the year 2087, responsible for preserving humanity’s digital heritage. Through a series of missions, you will learn how to safely read, write, manage, and protect data using Python.

This project focuses on:
- File reading and writing
- Using standard input, output, and error streams
- Context managers (with)
- Defensive programming and error handling
- Writing reliable programs that never corrupt data and never crash

# Given rules

Your code must be written in Python 3.10+

Your code must respect the flake8 linter standards

Each exercise must be in its own file

Use proper naming conventions

Classes in PascalCase

Functions and variables in snake_case

Include docstrings for functions, classes, and methods

Type hints are mandatory for all functions and methods

Only use the authorized functions and libraries specified per exercise

Use the with statement when required to ensure safe file handling

Use try/except blocks when required to handle system failures

Your programs must never crash, even in error scenarios

Focus on clear demonstration of file operations, streams, and error handling
